# Cocoon

## An interactive animation inspired by the 2006 animated film Pale Cocoon

### The Lore
In the film, the main character is living in a dystopian future where Earth has been decimated and humans must survive below ground. His daily job is archiving digital data that the remnants of humanity have found in hopes of rebuilding. Digital data, such as images, must be sorted into separate folders for archiving. The animation represents my attempt to mimic the behavior of the file explorer he uses within the fictional operating system. The rectangles on the left represent folders that show they're ready to accept the image by reaching towards it

### Usage
Move your mouse left and right across the screen. Your cursor is represented by the image. When the left edge of the image touches the vertical line, the rectangles on the left of the screen will reach out as if trying to touch the image. Move the mouse vertically to make different rectangles reach out
